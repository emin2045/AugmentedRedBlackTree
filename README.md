# AugmentedRedBlackTree


This project has red black tree algorithm and its augmented version. Made in Java.

In the project, a new parameter has been added to each node holds an
additional field. The additional field holds the number of all node’s age that
are smaller than the current node’s age. So that a new function has been
created and combine with upgraded GETNUMSMALLER2. Because,
function of GETNUMSMALLER2 had been used to find a number that using
a given ID but for AugmentedRedBlackTree each note has an extra field to
show a number so GETNUMSMALLER2 has been designed and upgraded to
show all numbers.
In conclusion, as advantages the program does not need function of
GETNUMSMALLER2 to show the number of all node’s age that are smaller
than the current node’s age. AugmentedRedBlackTree will be enough.
However, the program has a disadvantage. This disadvantage is taking up
extra memories because of node’s extra field.
